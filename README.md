# Frogger game
This was a project for a udacity front end web development course.  I was given tools and had to write the JavaScript code
to make a frogger video game work.

## How to run game
1.  clone this repo https://github.com/Nate03281982/frogger-udacity.git 
2.  run the index.html file in a browser

## How to play
1. move the boy sprite with the arrow keys
2. to win you must move the boy sprite to the water
3. you must avoid the cockroaches
4. if you get hit by a cockroach you lose and your boy sprite moves to the starting position
5. if you make it to the water you win and the game restarts

## Tools
1. Uacity provided starting material (game engine, resources, index.html and CSS) 
2. These items can be accessed at https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game.git
3. I also used a collision detection function
4. This can be accessed at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2440377/javascript-collision-detection
